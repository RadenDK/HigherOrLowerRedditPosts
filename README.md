# Higher Or Lower with AITA Posts

This project is a variation of the classic [Higher Lower Game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/), but with a twist—it involves scoring daily "Am I The A**hole" (AITA) posts from Reddit. You can experience the game on the deployed website: [Higher Or Lower Clone](http://higher-or-lower-clone.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Why I Created This Project

As a computer science student in Denmark, I realized my coursework lacked practical insights into web development. To challenge my frontend skills, explore different technologies, and understand their interactions, I decided to embark on this project. Despite my limited expertise, I sought to delve into the complexities of building a website.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Frontend Enhancement:** The frontend could benefit from some TLC to enhance its visual appeal and user experience.
2. **API and Database:** While I created a backend API interacting with a database through a daily Python script, I acknowledge a more straightforward approach would be having the API directly interact with the Reddit API. However, the complexity allowed me to learn about creating APIs connected to databases.
3. **Security Measures:** Admittedly, security measures need improvement to prevent exploitation—exercise caution.
4. **User Features:** Additional features like user login, score saving, a daily leaderboard, and refining the game concept could enhance user engagement. However, the project was wrapped up before exploring these possibilities due to a loss of interest.

## What I Learned

1. **Technology Mix:** Mixing various unknown technologies (frontend frameworks, APIs, databases, Docker, Heroku) posed challenges, especially for a beginner. It might have been more advisable to start with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **API Deployment:** Deploying an API as a Docker container on Heroku was a valuable learning experience, despite initial unfamiliarity with Docker and Heroku.
3. **Dependencies on AI:** Throughout the project, reliance on tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot played a significant role. While some may argue it hindered language mastery, my primary goal was to understand web development and deployment, which I achieved successfully.
4. **Learning Curve:** Although concepts like `UseEffect` remain a bit fuzzy, the overall learning curve was steep and rewarding.

In conclusion, this project served its purpose of broadening my understanding of web development and deployment, even if the path was unconventional and occasionally challenging.
